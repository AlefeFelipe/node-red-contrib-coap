This project adds CoAP support to [Node-RED](http://nodered.org/). It is based on Matteo Collina's [node-coap](https://github.com/mcollina/node-coap).

Functionality
-------------
 We introduce "coap request" and "coap in" nodes which can be used in a similar fashion to "http request"and "http in" nodes from Node-RED's core.

Installation
------------

```bash
cd $NODE_RED_HOME/nodes
git clone https://github.com/gatesense/node-red-contrib-coap.git
cd ./node-red-contrib-coap
npm install
```
